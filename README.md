# Vulnerabilities of autonomous vehicles and possible security solutions

This is the final report of the Robust Software class for the Masters in Cybersecurity, at University of Aveiro.

### Scenario

The scenario is simply a company that's trying to get into autonomous vehicles, for multiple purposes. The idea is that we provide a report for the full Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

The report for all this is provided in this repo.

Many thanks to my colleagues João Folgado and Fábio Ferreira who were my partners for this project.
